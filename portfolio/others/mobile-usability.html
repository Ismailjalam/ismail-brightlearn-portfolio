    <p>Usability Analysis – Mobile Banking Application</p>

  <section class="project-intro">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This usability testing report focuses on a mobile banking app prototype. 
      The goal was to evaluate ease of navigation, task efficiency, and user satisfaction 
      through real user testing sessions.
    </p>

  <section class="project-content">
    <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Assess how easily users can complete core banking tasks (transfer, check balance, pay bills).</li>
      <li>Identify usability issues that hinder efficiency or clarity.</li>
      <li>Measure user satisfaction through post-test interviews.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Test Method</h2>
    <p>
      Five participants (ages 21–45) were asked to perform specific tasks within a 
      clickable prototype built in Figma. Screen recording and user observation were used 
      to collect behavioral and emotional feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Navigation Confusion:</strong> 60% of users hesitated when locating the “Transfer Funds” option.</li>
      <li><strong>Button Size:</strong> Several touch targets were too small on mobile screens.</li>
      <li><strong>Confirmation Feedback:</strong> Lack of clear confirmation messages after transactions caused uncertainty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reposition the “Transfer Funds” option in the primary navigation bar.</li>
      <li>Increase button and icon size for better tap accuracy.</li>
      <li>Add transaction confirmation messages with success icons.</li>
    </ul>
